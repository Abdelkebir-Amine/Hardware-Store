General info :

1. The app allows users to manage products from a hardware store and place an order.

2. DB name = onlineStore (mySql).

3. DB Tables = Client(id,nom) | Produit(id,nom,nom_image) | Commande(id,date,client_id) | commande_produit(commande_id,produit_id).

4.  In this project, I have a OneToMany relationship between Customer and Order (a customer can place multiple orders), a ManyToOne relationship between Order and Customer (an order belongs to a single customer), and a ManyToMany relationship between Order and Product (an order can contain several products and a product can belong to several orders).

5. Working environment :
* IntelliJ development environment
* jdk-11.0.17
